```yaml
###
# 90% of all "*** Facts" pages are useless or redundant, so they don't need to be reviewed all the time.
# It is recommended to at least skim them, but they should only really be read if highlighted in this document
#
# SKIP)     = Skip this lesson or section as it is not important to the student
# LOOK)     = Student should read what this page contains
# SECT)     = Specific boxes will be selected for viewing. They will be specified by "SKIP)" or "LOOK)"
# OPT)      = Optional; It's up to the student if they'd like to read it
# LATER)    = Useful, but not this early (Come back to it later)
# BOLD      = Important; Should be talked about with students
#
# N/A = No further information; Treat this module as usual (Just helps with formatting)
#
# At the end of the day, it's up to the student to determine if they want to skip something.
# This is just an easier way to learn the material.

# Tree view glossary model

#       X.X Sub-Module Name:
#           X.X Assignment:
#               Information boxes (Found in "Facts" pages)
#
#   If the line does not end with a ":", then that is the end of the tree (There will be no further item
#   associated with it, based on YAML specification)
