MARKDOWN_L) [TestOut Linux+ Course Overview](https://guide.testout.com/overview/lxv6)

[
  Start with explaining how BASH parses command input

  For example;
    uname --help

  This means nothing to a student new to bash.
  You can tell them this gives info about the command, but then what?
  Is this special to the command? What signifies the command or how to pull up more help?
  Etc.

  Teach them how bash parses commands, so 'uname --help' becomes;
    'uname' [command]
    '--help' [arg0]

  Expand this to other built-in commands to show that this is a rule of standardization.
    'ls --help';
      'ls' [command]
      '--help' [arg0]

    'ls -la'
      'ls' [command]
      '-la' [arg1]

    [The same as]
      'ls' [command]
      '-l' [arg0]
      '-a' [arg1]


  Teach them to teach themselves.

  Bash order of operations;

    2. Process quotes [Evaluate quotation]
    3. Split the read data into commands [Split by ';' (separate commands on the same line)]
    4. Parse special operators [Piping, redirection, etc]
    4. Perform expansions [Variables, wildcards, etc]
    5. Split the command into a command name and arguments
